# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Naive Bayes

An applied machine learning project that predicts weather conditions using the **Naive Bayes classification algorithm**.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment through a simple Flask web application.
Planned evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
